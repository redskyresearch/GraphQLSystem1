# Project Title: Node.js, MongoDB & GraphQL Data Management System

## Description

This project is a Node.js application interfacing with MongoDB and GraphQL to manage a set of interconnected data collections. It leverages the power of MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to handle data with flexibility and efficiency, Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, to streamline interactions with the database, and GraphQL for building efficient and scalable APIs.

### Key Features:

- **Data Modeling with Mongoose:** Utilizes Mongoose to define models for three primary data collections: A, B, and C, with A being the parent collection.
- **Interconnected Collections:** Establishes relationships between collections, where B references entries in A, and C references entries in B, enabling a structured and relational approach to NoSQL data management.
- **GraphQL Integration:** Incorporates GraphQL to offer a powerful, flexible API for data queries and mutations, allowing clients to request exactly what they need and nothing more.
- **Simplified Data Queries:** Facilitates easy data retrieval and manipulation, leveraging MongoDBâ€™s powerful querying capabilities along with GraphQL's efficient data fetching.
- **Scalable Structure:** Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy expansion and modification of data models, relationships, and API endpoints as the project grows.
- **Robust Data Validation:** Implements data validation at the model level to ensure data integrity and reliability.

### Use Case:

This application serves as a backend system, ideal for projects requiring structured data relationships in a NoSQL environment with an efficient, flexible API layer. It's particularly suited for applications where data entities are closely related and require quick, efficient access and updates through a GraphQL API.


### Technical Stack:

- **Node.js:** For the runtime environment.
- **MongoDB:** As the NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose:** For modeling and managing data in MongoDB.
- **GraphQL:** For building flexible and efficient APIs.
- **Express.js:** As the web framework for building the API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js version 18
- npm
- MongoDB

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```

2. Install NPM packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the MongoDB server (if not running as a service):
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

4. Run the application once:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
5. Run the application with nodemon:
   ```bash
   npm dev
   ```
